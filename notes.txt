Package
	- workspace 
	- related code
	- Two types
		- Executable (Runnable files) 
			- Must be called "package main"
			- Must ALWAYS have "func main" as a function
			- GO build makes executable
		- Reusable (Helpers. Reusable logic) 
			- "Any other name will make reusable"
			- Makes no executable
	- Files in the same package can freely call functions defined in other files. WITHOUT import!

Run 
 - go run main.go
 - go run main.go deck.go 

Import
	- fmt (format)
	- golang.org/pkg (All standart packages)
		
functions
	- func bobFun()
	- func bobFunction(bobInput string) string  
	- Receiver function
		- func (d deck) print() 
			- Any variable of type "deck" now gets access to the print method

Basic types
	- bool
	- string
	- int
	- float64

Vars
	- var bob string = ""
	- bob := "" (Creating a new var)
	- bob = ""  (Reassigning an existing var)
	- Can do this, create and assign separatly:
		- var bob string
		- bob = "bob"
	- This initial creation can be done outside of function scope
	- assigning a variable outside of function scope it NOT possible

Data Structures
	- Array
		- Fixed length of records
	- Slice (0 indexed)
		- Can grow and shrink
		- bobSlice := []string{"bob", "bob2"} 
		- append(cards, "Six of Spades")
			- Returns a new slice of cards with a new element
		- Sub section 
			- cards[startIndexIncluding : upToButNotIncluding]
			- cards[0:3] 
			- you can optionally leave out either number e.g. cards[:3] or cards [10:]
		- swap positions
			- d[i], d[newPosition] = d[newPosition], d[i]

iterate
	- for i, card := range cards {
		fmt.Println(i, card)
      }

types
	- type bob []string
		- creates a type called bob, used to extend functionality of, in this case, a slice
	- See functions - receiver functions as to how to add functionality
	
Testing
	- file must end witn "_test.go"
	- to run "go test"
	- not many testing frameworks available
	- test function must start with capital T Test e.g. TestNewDeck

Struct
	- type person struct {
		fistName string
		lastName string
	  }
	- bob := person{"bob", "bobby"}
	- bob := person{firstName: "bob",lastName: "bobby"}

Zero values
	- string ""
	- int 0
	- float 0
	- bool false

Pointers
	- *variable (get the value of the variable)
	- &variable (get the address of a variable)
	- *type (Used in function, it means it requires a memory address that has a "type" value)
	- Gotchas
		- slice[0] = "bob" will update, this is because a slice is a data structure that has a pointer
					       to an array, so if a copy is made both copies will have a pointer to the same array
						   - this is called a referance type

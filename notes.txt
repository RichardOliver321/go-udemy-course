Package
	- workspace 
	- related code
	- Two types
		- Executable (Runnable files) 
			- Must be called "package main"
			- Must ALWAYS have "func main" as a function
			- GO build makes executable
		- Reusable (Helpers. Reusable logic) 
			- "Any other name will make reusable"
			- Makes no executable

Import
	- fmt (format)
	- golang.org/pkg (All standart packages)
		
functions
	- func bobFun()
	- func bobFunction(var bobInput) string  

Basic types
	- bool
	- string
	- int
	- float64

Vars
	- var bob string = ""
	- bob := "" (Creating a new var)
	- bob = ""  (Reassigning an existing var)
	- Can do this, create and assign separatly:
		- var bob string
		- bob = "bob"
	- This initial creation can be done outside of function scope
	- assigning a variable outside of function scope it NOT possible
